### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Paul Malenke. I am intersted in learning more about how to use coding and what applications I can apply it to in my career. I am currently trying to read the whole *Inheritance* series and am currently on *Eldest*. Some of my favorite hobbies are disc golfing and video games.
